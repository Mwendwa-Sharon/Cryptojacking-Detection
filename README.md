# Cryptojacking-Detection
Cryptojacking Detection Challenge. This repo contains a Machine Learning Model for Detecting Cryptojacking Attacks.

This repository contains code and resources for a Cryptojacking Detection Challenge project. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can detect instances of cryptojacking attacks in web traffic data. Cryptojacking is a growing threat in which malicious actors use other people's computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies without their consent, causing slowdowns and potential damage to the victim's hardware. The ability to detect cryptojacking attacks can help prevent further damage and protect against future attacks.

The project uses a dataset of web traffic logs that includes instances of both normal and cryptojacking traffic. The machine learning model is trained using various algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, and is optimized for accuracy and performance. The code is implemented in Python and uses various libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas for data processing and model building.

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation, as well as scripts for preprocessing and running the model. Additionally, it includes a README file with instructions on how to run the code and reproduce the results. This project can serve as a useful reference for anyone interested in developing machine learning models for detecting cryptojacking attacks in web traffic data.
